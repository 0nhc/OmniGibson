# üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

## üóíÔ∏è **Requirements**

Please make sure your system meets the following specs:

- [x] **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04+ / Windows 10+
- [x] **RAM:** 32GB+
- [x] **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2070+
- [x] **VRAM:** 8GB+

!!! warning "Docker install is currently not supported on Windows"

??? question "Why these specs?"
    
    **`OmniGibson`** is built upon NVIDIA's [Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) and [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) platforms, so we inherit their dependencies. For more information, please see [Isaac Sim's Requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/requirements.html).

## üíª **Setup**

You can quickly get **`OmniGibson`** immediately up and running from our pre-built üê≥ docker image:

??? info "Need to install docker or NVIDIA docker?"
    
    ```{.shell .annotate}
    # Install docker
    curl https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo systemctl --now enable docker

    # Install nvidia-docker runtime
    distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
        && curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | \
        sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
        && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | \
        sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
        sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2 # install
    sudo systemctl restart docker # restart docker engine
    ```

Install our docker launching scripts:
```shell
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson/main/docker/run_docker.sh
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson/main/docker/run_docker_gui.sh
chmod a+x run_docker.sh
chmod a+x run_docker_gui.sh
```

??? question annotate "What is being installed?"

    Our docker image automatically ships with a pre-configured conda virtual environment named `omnigibson` with Isaac Sim and **`OmniGibson`** pre-installed. Upon running the first time, our scene and object assets will automatically be downloaded as well. (1)

1.  üìä **Worried about dataset size?** We will ask whether you want to install our small demo dataset or full dataset of assets!


Then, simply launch the desired script:

=== "Headless"

    ```{.shell .annotate}
    sudo ./run_docker.sh <DATA_PATH> # (1)!
    ```

    1.  `<DATA_PATH>` specifies where data will be stored on your machine (if no `<DATA_PATH>` is specified, it defaults to `./omnigibson_data`). This needs to be called each time the docker container is run!


=== "GUI"

    ```{.shell .annotate}
    sudo ./run_docker_gui.sh <DATA_PATH> # (1)!
    ```

    1.  `<DATA_PATH>` specifies where data will be stored on your machine (if no `<DATA_PATH>` is specified, it defaults to `./omnigibson_data`). This needs to be called each time the docker container is run!

??? warning annotate "Are you using NFS or AFS?"

    Docker containers are unable to access NFS or AFS drives, so if `run_docker.sh` or `run_docker_gui.sh` are located on an NFS / AFS partition, please set `<DATA_PATH>` to an alternative data directory located on a non-NFS / AFS partition.

??? example annotate "Advanced: Installing from Source"

    This method is recommended for deeper users looking to develop upon **`OmniGibson`** or use it extensively for research. 

    
    1. Install [Conda](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+conda&rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS978US978&oq=install+conda&aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59l2j0i271j69i60l3.922j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

    2. Install NVIDIA's [Isaac Sim platform](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html) (1) (2)

    3. Export IsaacSim directory path as an environment variable: (3)

        On Linux (bash):
        ```shell
        export ISAAC_SIM_PATH=<YOUR_PATH_TO_ISAAC_SIM>
        ```

        On Windows (cmd):
        ```shell
        set ISAAC_SIM_PATH=<YOUR_PATH_TO_ISAAC_SIM>
        ```

    4. Clone [**`OmniGibson`**](https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson) and move into the directory:

        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson.git
        cd OmniGibson
        ```

    5. Run the command to setup a virtual conda environment to run **`OmniGibson`**:

        On Linux (bash):
        ```shell
        source setup_conda_env.sh
        ```

        On Windows (cmd):
        ```shell
        setup_conda_env.bat
        ```

        ??? info "Note for zsh users"
            bash is **strongly** recommended on Linux. If you are using zsh, you need to change `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` and `${BASH_SOURCE}` to `$0` in the first line of `<ISAAC_SIM_PATH>/setup_conda_env.sh` and `<ISAAC_SIM_PATH>/setup_python_env.sh` respectively in order for OG to work properly.
        
    6. This will automatically create an dump you into a conda env called `omnigibson`. If you need to activate this environment later, simply call:

        ```shell
        conda activate omnigibson
        ```

    7. üéâ Congrats! You installed **`OmniGibson`** successfully.  

1. Be sure keep track of where you choose Omniverse to write package files! By default this should be `~/.local/share/ov/pkg`

2. The latest version of Isaac Sim (2022.2.1) has known issues when loading large OG scenes. If you encounter such problems, it is recommended to use 2022.2.0 instead.

3. If you installed Isaac Sim to the default location, this is `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.1`



## üåé **Explore `OmniGibson`!**

??? warning annotate "Expect slowdown during first execution"

    Omniverse requires some one-time startup setup (up to ~5 minutes) when **`OmniGibson`** is imported for the first time. This is expected behavior, and should only occur once!

**`OmniGibson`** is now successfully installed! Try exploring some of our new scenes interactively:

```{.shell .annotate}
python -m omnigibson.examples.scenes.scene_selector # (1)!
```

1. This demo lets you choose a scene and interactively move around using your keyboard and mouse. Hold down **`Shift`** and then **`Left-click + Drag`** an object to apply forces!

You can also try teleoperating one of our robots:

```{.shell .annotate}
python -m omnigibson.examples.robots.robot_control_example # (1)!
```

1. This demo lets you choose a scene, robot, and set of controllers, and then teleoperate the robot using your keyboard.
